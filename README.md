# DeepLearning Technique for garbage classification
# Overview

This project aims to explore and implement deep learning techniques for garbage classification. The goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify different types of garbage items into categories such as biodegradable, cardboard, glass, metal,paper and plastic. By utilizing deep learning algorithms, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts of waste management and environmental sustainability.

# Introduction
Proper waste management is a critical aspect of maintaining a clean and sustainable environment. Garbage classification plays a pivotal role in this process, enabling effective recycling and disposal strategies. Deep learning techniques offer promising solutions to automate and improve the accuracy of garbage classification systems.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a diverse collection of garbage images, annotated with respective categories. It includes images of recyclable items such as plastic bottles, cans, cardboard, as well as non-recyclable items like styrofoam, mixed waste, and hazardous materials. The dataset is curated to represent real-world scenarios and challenges in garbage classification

 Garbage Object-Detection to Identify Disposal Class

This dataset detects various kinds of waste, labeling with a class that indentifies how it should be disposed.
# Techniques Used
.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are utilized for their ability to extract meaningful features from image data.

.Transfer Learning: we have  used  Pre-trained models as MobileNet , yoloV5  are fine-tuned on our dataset to leverage their learned representations.

.Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to increase the diversity of training samples.

.Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the performance of the models.
# Implementation
The project is implemented using Python and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow . Jupyter Notebooks are used for experimentation and model development. The code is organized into the following main components:

.Data preprocessing and augmentation

.Model definition and training

.Evaluation and metrics calculation

.Inference pipeline for new garbage images

# Results

After rigorous experimentation and training, our best model achieved an accuracy of 84% on the test set. The model demonstrates promising performance in classifying various types of garbage items accurately. Detailed results and performance metrics are presented in the project report.
